//   Question 5
// What is the difference between var and dynamic in Dart? Provide an example of
// each.
// var is a keyword that is used to declare a variable without telling the compiler the type of the variable
// while dynamic considers as a data type that can store any type of data
// example var name = 'Mohamed';
// it will use some of the memory rescources to configure the type of the variable it knows the type from the value assigned to it
// example of dynamic when revers data from outside and you can't determine the type of data
