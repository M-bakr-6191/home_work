  //Question 15
// What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it
// impact the way variables are used?
// answer: statically typed mean i can declare the typr of the varaiable at the compile time and it will not change during the run time 
// it will help in the reusability of the code that iam sure taht the type it will not change it will not cause any confilict later on
